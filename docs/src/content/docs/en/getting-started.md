Transcoder Suite is a powerful, modular system for batch video transcoding using PowerShell 7 and FFmpeg. This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before using the suite, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your system:

1.  **PowerShell 7+**: The script is optimized for PowerShell 7 features.
2.  **FFmpeg & FFprobe**: These tools must be installed and accessible in your system's `PATH`.
    - You can download them from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    - Verify installation by running `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amdphreak/transcoder-suite.git
    cd transcoder-suite
    ```

2.  **Verify Structure**: Ensure you see the `app/` folder containing `convert.ps1`, `playbooks/`, and `profiles/`.

## Running Your First Conversion

The simplest way to run the transcoder is from the root of the project:

```powershell
.\app\convert.ps1
```

### Interactive Setup

When you run the script without arguments, it will guide you through:
1.  **Playbook Selection**: Choose a transcoding recipe (e.g., AV1 Master Archive).
2.  **Session Name**: Give your job a name (defaults to current timestamp).
3.  **File Discovery**: The script will scan the current directory for video files.

### Next Steps

- Learn about [advanced usage](./usage) including command-line arguments.
- Understand how to customize [playbooks and profiles](./configuration).
