= Transcoder App
:toc: left

The core PowerShell application for the Transcoder Suite.

== Components

* `convert.ps1`: The main orchestration script.
* `playbooks/`: JSON files defining conversion recipes.
* `profiles/`: JSON files defining individual encoder settings for video and audio.
* `convert_jobs/`: (Generated) JSON files tracking session progress.

== Usage

Run the script from the root of the repository:

[source,powershell]
----
.\app\convert.ps1
----

Or from within the `app` folder:

[source,powershell]
----
.\convert.ps1
----

The script will automatically find playbooks and profiles relative to its location.
