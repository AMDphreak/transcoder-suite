= Transcoder Suite
:toc: left
:icons: font

Transcoder Suite is a modular, playbook-driven video transcoding system designed for high-quality archival and batch processing. It provides a robust framework for automating complex transcoding tasks using PowerShell 7 and FFmpeg.

== Project Goals

* **Quality**: Focus on high-bitrate, high-efficiency codecs like AV1 and Opus.
* **Consistency**: Ensure all media in a collection follows the same encoding standards.
* **Resilience**: Session-based processing that can be resumed after interruptions.
* **Automation**: Minimize manual configuration through reusable profiles and playbooks.

== Features

* **Modular Profiles**: Separate video and audio settings into reusable JSON components.
* **Playbook Orchestration**: Combine profiles into named "Playbooks" for different use cases (e.g., Deep Archival, Mobile Sync).
* **Session Management**: Resumable jobs stored in `app/convert_jobs/`. Never lose progress on a 100-file batch.
* **Smart Audio Handling**: Automatically detects and handles stereo vs. surround sound with appropriate bitrates.
* **SVT-AV1 Optimized**: Pre-configured for high-efficiency 10-bit AV1 encoding.
* **Atomic Writes**: Encodes to `.tmp` files to prevent file corruption on interruption.

== Project Structure

* `app/`: The core transcoding application (PowerShell script, profiles, and playbooks).
* `docs/`: Starlight-based documentation site.

== Getting Started

=== Application

The main application is located in the `app/` directory.

. **Prerequisites**:
** Install FFmpeg and FFprobe and ensure they are in your PATH.
** PowerShell 7+.

. **Run the converter**:
+
[source,powershell]
----
.\app\convert.ps1
----

. **Select a Playbook**: Choose from the available recipes in the `app/playbooks/` directory.

=== Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at link:https://ryanjohnson.dev/transcoder-suite/[ryanjohnson.dev/transcoder-suite/].

To run the documentation site locally:

[source,bash]
----
cd docs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
----

== Directory Structure (App)

* `app/profiles/`: Individual encoder settings (Video/Audio).
* `app/playbooks/`: Orchestration recipes.
* `app/convert_jobs/`: Session progress and failure logs (ignored by git).
* `app/convert.ps1`: The main entry point script.

== Internationalization

The documentation is available in:
* English
* Spanish (Español)
* French (Français)
